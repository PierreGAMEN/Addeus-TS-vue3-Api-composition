# Personalised cover letter based on the Addeus website

This page is a personalised cover letter based on the Addeus website.

I first created the whole thing in ‘vueJS 2’, then reworked it to take a more modern approach and use ‘Vue JS 3’ and its ‘composition API’. I also wrote my code in JS first and then switched to TS.

This is a pure front-end project with two objectives:

- To work on my level of integration of a model/website.
- To respond to the Addeus job offer.

## Staks

- VueJS 3 - API composition
- Typescript
- Scss
- Vite

## Want to see the result ?
